Arduino intervalometer / time-lapse dolly v. 0.2
================================================

This is an Arduino based project. The goal is to create simple yet usable intervalometer and motor controlled dolly.

Current status

- I soldered the intervalometer parts into a pcb breadboard couple of days ago, works just fine
- I'm currently engineering the dolly, this may take some time...

Hardware

- Arduino Uno
- Adafruit motor shield (only if dolly is used)
- some kind of prototyping circuit board or a breadboard
- 7 segment 2-digit LED display (common cathode or anode)
- motor (type and more info to come when I start to build the dolly)
- dolly materials, coming later...

Components

- 5 pushbuttons
- 6 x 2,2 kohm resistors (for 5 buttons, system works with other resistors too but code needs to be changed)
- 1 x 500-600 ohm resistor
- 1 x 4N35 optocoupler (I suppose 4N25 etc. will work fine too)
- wire to connect in camera, most of the cameras use 2,5mm
- wire

Tools

- soldering equipment
